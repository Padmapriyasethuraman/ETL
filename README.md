# ETL Demo Script

 Overview
This script demonstrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process that retrieves exchange rate data from the Bank of Canada.
Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: 
  - `petl`
  - `pymssql`
  - `configparser`
  - `requests`
  - `openpyxl`

Installation
1. Install Python libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install petl pymssql configparser requests openpyxl
   ```

2. Create a configuration file:**
   - Name the file `ETLDemo.ini` and place it in the same directory as the script.
   - The file should have the following format:
     ```ini
     [CONFIG]
     startDate = YYYY-MM-DD
     url = <URL to fetch data>
     server = <Database server address>
     database = <Database name>
     user = <Database username>
     password = <Database password>
     ```

3. Prepare the Excel file:**
   - Name the file `Expenses.xlsx`.
   - Create a sheet named `Github` with your expense data.



- Expenses.xlsx:
  - Ensure the file contains a sheet named `Github` with expense data, including a `date` column and a `USD` column.

Execution
1. Ensure the configuration file `ETLDemo.ini` is correctly set up.
2. Place the `Expenses.xlsx` file in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python ETL_sample.py
   ```
  
   
Error Handling
- The script includes error handling for:
  - Configuration file read errors
  - Data fetch errors
  - File read errors
  - Database connection errors
  - Database write errors
- If an error occurs, an error message is printed, and the script exits.

Example Configuration
```ini
[CONFIG]
startDate = 2023-01-01
url = https://api.bankofcanada.ca/forex/
server = mydatabase.server.com
database = mydatabase
user = myuser
password = mypassword
```
